Thanks for downloading and using my assets!

These we're exported in a rush to get it out there!
which means that its kinda like a drag and drop, but you have to
link the images to the models!

don't think you have to convert the models since geryhound should do that
but keep it in mind.

Quick tip!,
If it asks to overwrite some files i would say press on "NO"
cuz you already have it so those files are same as in bo4 and it might just
mess up some assets on your end!

I've looked through those files and images and have seen some perk icons and stuff,
so yea those are in there i guess...

its hard to export all models and stuff since they are named as ---> cfbdsfbcjkdcfnjkbh.xmodel

all i did is search "zm" then exported all the models that was on the screen xD
